    "Hangman is a word guessing game where a random word is selected and a player is given a number of attempts to guess the word by entering a letter that he/she thinks is part of the word. The player wins if he/she is able to enter all the letters that makes up the word within the number of attempts he/she is given and loses if he/she cannot enter all the letters to form the word.\n",
    "When the game starts, the letters in the word will be hidden and the player will start to enter letters that he/she thinks is part of the word. If a letter in the word is entered correctly, the letter and its corresponding positing in the word will be revealed. An example of the game play is shown below (a dot \"`.`\" is used to indicate the position of a letter in the word that has not been guessed correctly):\n",
