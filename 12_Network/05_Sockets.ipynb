It consists of an ip address and a port number\n","\n","Development of application programs that makes use of these socket address to communicate is called **socket/network programming**.\n","\n","The most common type for socket applications are client-server applications, where we have a server part and a client part. As the name suggests:\n","- the server part wait for requests from the clients\n","- clients request services from the servers.\n","\n","### Server Program\n","To code an iterative server program in Python, we carry out the following in steps:\n","1. import `socket` module,\n","2. create a `socket` object, default is ipv4, tcp.  [see reference](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#constants)\n","3. assign an IP address and port number to the socket object using the `bind()` method. `bind()` takes in a tuple of IP address and port number `(ip,port)`. If `ip=''`, then the socket will listen from *any computer* in the network. Take note that port numbers 0 to 1023 should be avoided as they're reserved. In A-Level, you're only required to create a server program that communicates with interacts with a client program on the same computer, so `ip= '127.0.0.1'`, which refers to localhost.\n","4. The server first creats a queue of n incoming connections by using the `listen(n)`, default is 128.\n","5. using a while loop, we accept incoming connections to that socket using `accept()` method. `accept()` returns a tuple consisting of :\n","    - a `connection socket` object\n","    - a tuple consistent of `(ip_adress, port_number)` of the remote client.\n","6. with the `connection socket` object from part 5, we can now either:\n","    - receive message using `recv(n)` method. The parameter n is an integer indicating maximum amount of data to retrieved from the receive buffer. The operation blocks when there are no data in the buffer and returns b'' when the connection is terminated by the sender\n","    - send message using `send()` method. `send()` takes in `bytes` object as parameters, as such we need to encode the data first using `encode()` method.\n","7. process the data as needed\n","8. close the connection by using `close()` method on the connection object.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"y6oTy7c7x4pd"},"source":["\n","\n","### Transport Layer: TCP (Tranmission Control Protocol) vs UDP ( User Datagram Protcol)\n","| Feature                | TCP                                      | UDP                                      |\n","|------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n","| **Connection**         | Connection-oriented (handshake)          | Connectionless                           |\n","| **Reliability**        | Guaranteed delivery, ordered             | Best-effort, no guarantees               |\n","| **Overhead**           | High (ACKs, retransmissions)             | Low                                      |\n","| **Use Cases**          | Accuracy-critical applications           | Speed-critical applications              |\n","||Example: Banking APP, Netflix |Example: Voice  |\n","\n","Choosing between TCP and UDP depends on whether your application prioritizes **reliability** (TCP) or **speed and simplicity** (UDP)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"7cWsyPNYx4pc"},"source":["## A level Requires\n","    - Client Server Architecture\n","    - Iterative , Single-Threaded Server\n","    - use TCP as transport"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"yApDRPtnfiZ7"},"outputs":[],"source":["## Echo Server version 1, just print the message from the Client\n","\n","from socket import socket\n","\n","# choose transport layer\n","\n","\n","#socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n","\n","# (1) Create a TCP or UDP socket (SOCK_DGRAM for UDP)\n","#udp_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)\n","listen_socket = socket() ## ipv4, TCP default ## Which Trasport to use TCP or UDP\n","\n","## (2) bind socket to (IP_Address, Port Number)\n","listen_socket.bind( ('127.0.0.1', 1234))  # avoid using well-known port number 443, 25\n","\n","## (3)\"Make socket listen for incoming connections\n","print(\"Server in listen mode ...\")\n","listen_socket.listen(5) ## create a queue for incoming client connections\n","## Server processing loop\n","## while the server is busy running, any incoming client connection will be put in the queue\n","\n","while True: ## iterative Server\n","    ## (4) blocks and wait for client connection\n","    client_socket, remote_address = listen_socket.accept() ## blocking call\n","    print( f\"Accept connection from {remote_address[0]}:{remote_address[1]}\")\n","\n","    # (5) receive from the client buffer or send to client, depending on protocol\n","    message = client_socket.recv(1024) #?? what shoul be a optimal size\n","    # (6) Decode and print message\n","    message = message.decode()\n","    print(message)\n","    #(7) Send acknowledgment\n","    client_socket.sendall(b\"OK\")\n","    #(8) Close client connection\n","    client_socket.close()\n","    ## How to exit the while loop\n","    if \"bye\" in message:\n","        break\n","\n","# Terminating the server listenin port\n","listen_socket.close()\n","print(\"Closing listen socket\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"oDm8bDBrfiZ7"},"source":["##### Echo Server version 2\n","1.
